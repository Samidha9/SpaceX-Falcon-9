#  SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis Project

##  Problem Statement

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches play a critical role in reducing the cost of space missions by reusing boosters. However, mission outcomesâ€”especially booster landingsâ€”are influenced by multiple factors like launch site, payload mass, and booster type. The goal of this project is to analyze historical Falcon 9 launch data, predict mission success using machine learning, and build an interactive dashboard to visualize insights for decision-making.

##  Project Overview

This end-to-end data science project uses SpaceX launch data to:
- Extract and clean data from API and web sources
- Explore trends via visual and geospatial analysis
- Query insights using SQL
- Build ML models to predict mission success
- Deploy a Dash dashboard to interact with the data

---

##  Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, SQLite, BeautifulSoup, Plotly, Dash, Folium, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Components Breakdown

### 1. Data Collection
- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb`
- Pulls SpaceX launch data using REST API
- Normalizes JSON into structured DataFrame

### 2. Web Scraping
- `SpaceX-web-scraping.ipynb`
- Extracts booster landing data from HTML tables using BeautifulSoup
- Merges scraped data with API results

### 3. Data Wrangling
- `Spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb`
- Cleans, merges, and standardizes datasets
- Saves combined data as `spacex_launch_geo.csv`

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- `SpaceX-EDA-Data-Visualization.ipynb`
- Analyzes launch success rates by site and payload
- Uses scatter plots, pie charts, and bar graphs

### 5. SQL-Based Analysis
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`
- Loads cleaned CSV into SQLite
- Uses SQL queries to validate and explore trends

### 6. Geospatial Visualization
- `SpacexX-Folium-Visualization.ipynb`
- Uses Folium to map launch sites with interactive markers
- Shows success/failure by location

### 7. Machine Learning
- `SpaceX-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Part-5-v1.ipynb`
- Builds classifiers (LogReg, SVM, Tree) to predict mission outcome
- Uses payload, site, booster version as features
- Evaluates models with confusion matrices and accuracy scores

## Interactive Dashboard

- Built using Dash & Plotly with live controls
- Dropdown filters, scatter and pie charts, payload slider
- Launch site and booster version selection
